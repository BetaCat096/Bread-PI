# Bread-PI
This gets funny. 
#What is the Bread-PI
The bread pi was an experiment to attempt to toast bread using a raspberry pi. It failed badly. The raspberry pi surged, set the bread on fire, 
stopped taking commands. I had to turn off the mains. From that day it was called the Bread Pi. The case was mealted, deatroyed and full of crumbs. 
It does not work anymore...
